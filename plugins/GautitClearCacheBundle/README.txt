You Gautit!!  Thank you for getting the Delete Cache plugin from Gautit.

Delete the cache within Mautic!

Many issues within Mautic can be resolved by clearing the cache/prod folder. 

Even adding new plugins and themes it is recommended to clear the cache.

Until now, you had to use your FTP client or SSH to do this.  Not very user friendly.

Install and activate this plugin and a new menu item, Clear Cache will be added to the settings menu.

Every time you wish to clear the cache, open settings (the gear in the top right), select clear cache, and you will get a message once the cache is cleared.

How easy is that!
